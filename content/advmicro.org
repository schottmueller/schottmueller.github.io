* News
- The exam starts at 14:30 (and not at 14:00 as I had wrongly announced on this page before). PhD students who cannot register via KLIPS for the exam should send me an email with their name and student number before the exam.
# - Starting with the signaling lecture on May 22, please do not watch the screencasts but read the corresponding chapter in the reading material before coming to class. Keep, however, preparing the exercises on the exercise pdf. (If you are interested in some of the exercises from the book, I am, of course, happy to discuss those as well.)
# - We will skip the "Auctions" chapter and deal with "Dynamic Games I" on May 8 (screencasts 12-15).
# - Please watch the screencasts on Dominance and rationalizability (01-03) before coming to the first class.
# - I updated the [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/ND5jNpFeixTYTI0][notes]] on mechanism design.

# - Some [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/x11iTai5SSTkq4v][notes]] on game theory were added (the password was announced in the lecture, please ask me if you missed it) where you can check how to determine Bayesian Nash equilibria in sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2. Comments on these notes are very welcome. 

# - We will skip the topic "Nash equilibrium" and will talk about "Bayesian Nash equilibrium" on April 25. Please, watch screencasts 07-09 until then. 
# - As I am attending an international conference, there is no lecture on April 11. The first lecture will be on April 18. Please watch screencasts 01-03 before the lecture on April 18 and have a look at the corresponding exercises.
#  - Exam grades will be published soon. PhD students can pick up their certificates at the secretariat (SSC 4.302-4.304) but due to technical problems not before July 26 (maybe call in beforehand to make sure that someone is in).
    
# - The second exam is planned for September 30, 14:00. Registration via KLIPS is open now. PhD students should register via mail to [c dot schottmueller at uni minus koeln dot de].
# - On July ?, we use the class for question hour. If you want to have an answer for sure, please send me your questions before July ?.
# - resit date: October 7, 16:00-17:00 in SSC 4.210
 - exam date: July 17, 14:30-15:30 in the usual lecture room

* Time and place
- Thursday, 14:00-17:30, Seminarraum S243 (101/01/1.303)

* Setup
Each week you have either to watch some screencasts or to read a book chapter before coming to class. In class, you then have the possibility to ask questions about the material (and I might ask you a few questions to see whether things are clear). Afterwards we do the exercises. In terms of /preparation/, you have to watch the screencasts (or read the book chapter). Furthermore, you have to read through the exercises on the respective topic and think roughly 10 minutes about each of them. (Don't be discouraged if you do not manage to solve them quickly. Some of them are quite challenging.)  One organizational remark: as we have only one projector, it is useful to bring a printout of the exercises with you to class.

* Prerequisites
I assume that you have some introductory knowledge of game theory on the level of [cite:@gibbons1992primer]. In particular, you should know the material in chapters 1 and 2 in Gibbons' book (strategic form games, dominance, mixed strategies, mixed and pure Nash equilibrium, extensive form games, game trees, backwards induction, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium) and be able to apply it in simple games. From Advanced Microeconomics I, we build upon the part about /decision making under uncertainty/ (expected utility theorem). In terms of mathematics, it is helpful to master the material of the course /Advanced Mathematics for Economists/. Having said that, most of the used math tools will not be far beyond high school maths. At the minimum you have to know (partial) differentiation, integration and optimization of functions and basic statistics (discrete and continuous probability distributions, expected values as well as Bayes' rule and conditional probabilities). More importantly, you should also have some idea of what a mathematical proof is. There is a handout on maths covering some of the prerequisites and topics that people tend to forget about quickly. 

* Other books

Most material is covered in [cite:@mas1995microeconomic] which is abbreviated MWG in the following. Roughly speaking, we will cover chapters 8, 9, 13 and 23 from this book.

Some other interesting books on game theory covering the course material partially are
- [cite:@fudenberg1991game] (FT): Covers an impressive amount of material in considerable depth at PhD level. Some of the proofs are, however, not fully worked out.
- [cite:@maschler2013game] (MSZ): Impresses with very clear proofs and fully worked out examples. Do, however, not expect to find much economics in this book.
- [cite:@osborne1994course] (OR). A very nice book that is freely available for download from the authors' websites. 

For mechanism design, [cite:@boergers2015] is an excellent source which naturally covers much more than we do in the course.
