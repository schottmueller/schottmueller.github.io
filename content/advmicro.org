* News
- For June 27, please do not watch the videos but read the second chapter of these [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/ecB5nmjU3bnJSpc][notes]] instead. Feedback on the notes is very welcome. We will cover the exercises in the second chapter of the notes and possibly exercise 2 of section 9 on the exercise sheet.

- Some [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/x11iTai5SSTkq4v][notes]] on game theory were added (the password was announced in the lecture, please ask me if you missed it) where you can check how to determine Bayesian Nash equilibria in sections 1.2.1 and 1.2.2. Comments on these notes are very welcome. 

- On May 2, we will talk about Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Please, have a look at the provided [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/McPf9#3MzYHARzJK1cB069EeGOqA][solutions]] for some of the BNE exercises before coming to class. To make up for the canceled lecture on April 25, we will have a Zoom meeting on Tuesday evening (May 7) at 17:30 in which we will talk about auctions. To keep the zoom meeting short, I will write down solutions to all the auction exercises beforehand and we will talk in the meeting only about specific questions that you have concerning either the screencast or the exercises/solutions. (Meeting ID: 991 9519 7189;Password: 519315)
- Due to health issues, there is no lecture on April 25. I will inform you as soon as I am better about a make up meeting.

- We will skip the topic "Nash equilibrium" and will talk about "Bayesian Nash equilibrium" on April 25. Please, watch screencasts 07-09 until then. 
# - As I am attending an international conference, there is no lecture on April 11. The first lecture will be on April 18. Please watch screencasts 01-03 before the lecture on April 18 and have a look at the corresponding exercises.
#  - Exam grades will be published soon. PhD students can pick up their certificates at the secretariat (SSC 4.302-4.304) but due to technical problems not before July 26 (maybe call in beforehand to make sure that someone is in).
    
# - The second exam is planned for September 30, 14:00. Registration via KLIPS is open now. PhD students should register via mail to [c dot schottmueller at uni minus koeln dot de].
# - On July ?, we use the class for question hour. If you want to have an answer for sure, please send me your questions before July ?.
# - resit date: October 7, 16:00-17:00 in SSC 4.210
 - exam date: July 18, 14:00-15:00 in the usual lecture room

* Time and place
 - Thursday, 14:00-17:30, Seminarraum 3.03 (118/03/3.03)

* Setup
Please, watch the screencasts provided below before coming to class. You have the option to ask questions about the material in the screencasts (and I might ask you a few questions to see whether things are clear). We will then do the exercises. In terms of /preparation/, you have to watch the screencasts and read through the exercises on the respective topic and think roughly 10 minutes about each of them. (Don't be discouraged if you do not manage to solve them quickly. Some of them are a bit tricky.)  One organizational remark: as we have only one projector, it is useful to bring a printout of the exercises with you to class.

* Prerequisites
I assume that you have some introductory knowledge of game theory on the level of [cite:@gibbons1992primer]. In particular, you should know the material in chapters 1 and 2 in Gibbons' book (strategic form games, dominance, mixed strategies, mixed and pure Nash equilibrium, extensive form games, game trees, backwards induction, subgame perfect Nash equilibrium) and be able to apply it in simple games. From Advanced Microeconomics I, we build upon the part about /decision making under uncertainty/ (expected utility theorem). In terms of mathematics, it is helpful to master the material of the course /Advanced Mathematics for Economists/. Having said that, most of the used math tools will not be far beyond high school maths. At the minimum you have to know (partial) differentiation, integration and optimization of functions and basic statistics (discrete and continuous probability distributions, expected values as well as Bayes' rule and conditional probabilities). More importantly, you should also have some idea of what a mathematical proof is. There is a handout on maths covering some of the prerequisites and topics that people tend to forget about quickly. 

* Books

Most material is covered in [cite:@mas1995microeconomic] which is abbreviated MWG in the following. Roughly speaking, we will cover chapters 8, 9, 13 and 23 from this book.

Some other interesting books on game theory covering the course material partially are
- [cite:@fudenberg1991game] (FT): Covers an impressive amount of material in considerable depth at PhD level. Some of the proofs are, however, not fully worked out.
- [cite:@maschler2013game] (MSZ): Impresses with very clear proofs and fully worked out examples. Do, however, not expect to find much economics in this book.
- [cite:@osborne1994course] (OR). A very nice book that is freely available for download from the authors' websites. 

For mechanism design, [cite:@boergers2015] is an excellent source which naturally covers much more than we do in the course.
