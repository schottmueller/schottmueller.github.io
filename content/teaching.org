**  Thesis supervision

My [[./thesis_guidelines.html][guidelines]] for *thesis supervision*. Please, read before contacting my chair. If you write your thesis at my chair, have a look at the $\LaTeX$ templates below and maybe also at the seminar guidelines or the numerical tools.

** Material for students
*** Seminar guidelines
    Some [[./files/writingSeminar.pdf][guidelines]] on how to write a *literature based seminar paper* may also be helpful when writing a Master thesis. For formatting suggestions, see the $\LaTeX$ section below.

*** $\LaTeX$

I created a template for students who want to get started with $\LaTeX$. Read the "Getting Started" part as well as the page on "Document Structure" of the [[https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX][wikibook]] first. These parts also cover the installation of $\LaTeX$ and of a useable text editor (for beginners I recommend TeXmaker as an editor). Reading and installation should take you less than 90 minutes and those might be the best invested 90 minutes of your student life. Then have a look at the following files: [[./teaching/LaTeXTemplate.tex][.tex]] (with explanations of common usage), [[./teaching/privacy.bib][.bib]] (bibliography file), example [[./teaching/Vprime.png][graphic]], [[./teaching/LaTeXTemplate.pdf][.pdf]] (the compiled output), plain  [[./teaching/LaTeXTemplatePlain.tex][.tex]] template. If the use of BibTeX for citations is unclear, check Martin Osborne's [[https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/osborne/latex/BIBTEX.HTM][guide]].

The template above is relatively simple and well suited for term papers or a Bachelor project. There is another template for Master theses which contains a title page, table of contents etc.:  [[./teaching/thesisTempl.tex][.tex]], [[./teaching/thesisTempl.pdf][.pdf]], you need the same example [[./teaching/Vprime.png][graphic]]  and [[./teaching/privacy.bib][bibliography]] as above and also the [[./teaching/UoCseal.pdf][seal]] of the university in the same folder as the .tex file.

*** Numerical tools for economists

I created some jupyter notebooks that explain how you can make professionally looking plots, numerically solve maximization problems and numerically solve (systems of) equations. I think all of this can be extremely helpful when writing a seminar paper or a thesis. The backend for all this is the [[https://julialang.org][julia]] programming language but no prior knowledge of programming is required. The notebooks can be found [[https://github.com/schottmueller/juliaForMicroTheory][here]]. If you want to learn programming in julia from scratch, you may want to check out this [[https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html][tutorial]]. (For, more examples where Julia is used to solve problems in (macro)economics, see [[https://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/][here]].)

*** Mathematics 
Microeconomic theory makes heavy use of mathematics. The following books are recommended background reading in mathematics:
- for Bachelor students in economics: Simon and Blume, "Mathematics for Economists", W.W. Norton & Company, 1994
- for Master students in economics: (part I and II in) de la Fuente, "Mathematical Methods and Models in Economics", Cambridge University Press, 2000
- for PhD students in economics: Ok, "Real Analysis with Economic Applications", Princeton University Press, 2007
