# - The optional exam inspection will take place on April 22, see [[https://wiso.uni-koeln.de/de/studium/studienorganisation/klausureinsichtnahmen/economics][here]] for details and registration.
# - The optional exam inspection is planned to take place on June 5, 10:00-10:30 in SSC 4.210. Please, register between April 26 and May 10 with an email to /ndiaye at wiso.uni-koeln dot de/ inclusing your name, student number and examination date.
# - The exam inspection will be combined for both exam dates and  take place in April.
#  - Screencasts on exercises are on [[https://uni-koeln.sciebo.de/s/urCdimezGeZTWDu][sciebo]].
    # [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/MwvWL#cGBt8FG0QCGB_gL8B2pvQw][26c]], [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/fdeXk#JRJtgz-IuaK-hzgTr6T8Iw][27]], [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/e8WnF#-qH2_6NY_MhFYopm_fZ6Zg][28]], [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/HcnLl#GFudqekvaTxUJHKsRqG0zQ][29]] were added.
# - The website of the examination office contains the relevant information regarding the exam inspection.  
# - Exam results are published on KLIPS. 
# - Some information on the exam that was given in the last lecture:
 #  - You do not need a calculator in the exam.
#   - If you really want to bring a calculator to hold onto, you can do so but your calculator must (i) not be graphical (no function plotting etc.), (ii) not be able to solve equations or systems of equations with unknown variables (e.g. if you can input 3*x+9=5, then you cannot use the calculator), (iii) not be able to store text, (iv) not be able to determine integrals. This implies that many calculators listed on the website of the WiSo examination office are not allowed. 
#   - The exam consists of 2 or 3 exercises (which each may have 1-3 subquestions). Not finishing all exercises within 60 minutes is an option that should not scare you.  
# - In the last lecture (Feb. 4), I will only answer questions. We will not cover the Spence signaling model and this model will not be part of the exam (the binary signaling model, i.e. the pirate story, however is relevant for the exam). If you are interested in the Spence model, you can watch this [[https://web.tresorit.com/l/pnuTt#Ykzctmj2R-PkxcosnxLLmw][screencast]] I recorded last year.

# - There is no exercise class in the first week of the semester, i.e. we start with the lecture on October 10.
# - We will skip exercise 20 (on the poker game) in the exercise session.
- There is no exercise session in the first week of the semester (October 15).
- I do not use ILIAS because I prefer openly accessible material and dislike parts of the terms of service. All material for this course is available on this website.
- calculator policy: calculators are neither needed nor allowed in the exam
- exam dates: Feb 5, 2026, 14:30 (HSA1) and March 16, 2026, 10:00 (Aula 2); /registration via KLIPS/

** Textbooks
The provided lecture notes cover all topics. An alternative textbook is [cite:@jehle2001advanced]. On auctions, Paul Klemperer's book [cite:@klemperer2004auctions] is an interesting (optional!) read but goes beyond the material covered in this course.

* Schedule
The following schedule is subject to changes. Exercise numbers refer to the exercises at the end of each lecture note chapter (* refers to the chapter "Beliefs and Inference"). You should have a look at the exercises before coming to the exercise session.

On /Prerequisites/: If you are not familiar with one of the topics mentioned as prerequisite, please check the math notes on sciebo or wikipedia and your favorite generative AI model before coming to the lecture. If you favor a slower but more thorough approach, consult [cite:@gibbons1992primer] or [cite:@tadelis2013game] for game theory, [cite:@varian2016intermediate] for microeconomics, [cite:@sydsaeter2008essential] for mathematics and [cite:@ross2020first] for probability theory.
